    abstract = "{Simulation from the truncated multivariate normal distribution in high dimensions is a recurrent problem in statistical computing and is typically only feasible by using approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a minimax tilting method for exact independently and identically distributed data simulation from the truncated multivariate normal distribution. The new methodology provides both a method for simulation and an efficient estimator to hitherto intractable Gaussian integrals. We prove that the estimator has a rare vanishing relative error asymptotic property. Numerical experiments suggest that the scheme proposed is accurate in a wide range of set-ups for which competing estimation schemes fail. We give an application to exact independently and identically distributed data simulation from the Bayesian posterior of the probit regression model.}",

  Abstract                 = {Quantum field theory in curved space-times is a well developed area in mathematical physics which has had important phenomenological applications to the very early universe. However, it is not commonly appreciated that on time-dependent space-times including the simplest cosmological models-dynamics of quantum fields is not unitary in the standard sense. This issue is first explained with an explicit example, and it is then shown that a generalized notion of unitarity does hold. The generalized notion allows one to correctly pass to the Schrödinger picture starting from the Heisenberg picture used in the textbook treatments. Finally, we indicate how these considerations can be extended from simple cosmological models to general globally hyperbolic space-times.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of $H_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields $\Omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature $\Omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM. While the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshifts remain consistent with our constraints, but models where dark matter decays into radiation are sharply limited. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species, improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a two-dimensional model of inflation, where the inflationary trajectory is ``deformed'' by a grazing encounter with an Extra Species/Symmetry Point (ESP) after the observable cosmological scales have left the Hubble radius. The encounter entails a sudden production of particles, whose backreaction causes a bending of the trajectory and a temporary decrease in speed, both of which are sensitive to initial conditions. This ``modulated'' effect leads to an additional contribution to the curvature perturbation, which can be dominant if the encounter is close. We compute associated non-Gaussianities, the bispectrum and its scale dependence as well as the trispectrum, which are potentially detectable in many cases. In addition, we consider a direct modulation of the coupling to the light field at the ESP via a modulaton field, a mixed scenario whereby the modulaton is identified with a second inflaton, and an extended Extra Species Locus (ESL); all of these scenarios lead to similar additional contributions to observables. We conclude that inflaton interactions throughout inflation are strongly constrained if primordial non-Gaussianities remain unobserved in current experiments such as PLANCK. If they are observed, an ESP encounter leaves additional signatures on smaller scales which may be used to identify the model.},

  Abstract                 = {The accelerated expansion of space during the cosmological inflation period leads to trans-Planckian issues which need to be addressed. Most importantly, the physical wavelength of fluctuations which are studied at the present time by means of cosmological observations may well originate with a wavelength smaller than the Planck length at the beginning of the inflationary phase. Thus, questions arise as to whether the usual predictions of inflationary cosmology are robust considering our ignorance of physics on trans-Planckian scales, and whether the imprints of Planck-scale physics are at the present time observable. These and other related questions are reviewed in this paper.},

In particular we calculate the spectral indices to second order in slow-roll parameters. We show that the cross correlation of the curvature and isocurvature perturbations at the time of Hubble exit during inflation is nonzero at first order in slow-roll parameters. We apply our results to different classes of inflation, including inflaton and curvaton scenarios. The spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, curvature and isocurvature perturbations obey generalized consistency relations in two-field inflation models. We give the first two consistency relations in an infinite hierarchy.},

  abstract      = {This white paper describes the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the question of unitary implementation of the dynamics for scalar fields in cosmological scenarios. Together with invariance under spatial isometries, the requirement of a unitary evolution singles out a rescaling of the scalar field and a unitary equivalence class of Fock representations for the associated canonical commutation relations. Moreover, this criterion provides as well a privileged quantization for the unscaled field, even though the associated dynamics is not unitarily implementable in that case. We discuss the relation between the initial data that determine the Fock representations in the rescaled and unscaled descriptions, and clarify that the S-matrix is well defined in both cases. In our discussion, we also comment on a recently proposed generalized notion of unitary implementation of the dynamics, making clear the difference with the standard unitarity criterion and showing that the two approaches are not equivalent.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnitude of B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background as measured by BICEP2 favours models of chaotic inflation with a quadratic m2 phi2/2 potential, whereas data from the Planck satellite favour a small value of the tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio r that is highly consistent with the Starobinsky R +R2 model. Reality may lie somewhere between these two scenarios. In this paper we propose a minimal two-field no-scale supergravity model that interpolates between quadratic and Starobinsky-like inflation as limiting cases, while retaining the successful prediction ns simeq 0.96.},

  abstract =  {Slater-type basis sets are commonly used to perform nonrelativistic and relativistic variational calculations. A major limitation of this method is that no more than about 14 powers per nonlinear parameter can be used while working in double-precision arithmetic without entering into numerical difficulties. Even for moderate-size basis sets, large numerical errors are introduced. We introduce a variational method based on the orthogonality properties of the Laguerre polynomials. All the matrix elements of the Dirac Hamiltonian are calculated in closed form, therefore avoiding numerical cancellations and vastly increasing the speed of the calculations. As a result, full double-precision accuracy is maintained with very large basis sets. Results for sets with 75 powers are given as examples. The method is applied to a new, very accurate relativistic calculation of the two-photon decay rates for hydrogenic ions. This calculation resolves a discrepancy between the previous calculation of Parpia and Johnson [Phys. Rev. A 26, 1142 (1982)] and that by Goldman and Drake [Phys. Rev. A 24, 183 (1981)] in favor of the latter.},

For the associated Hamiltonian operators, even those generating evolution along timelike vector fields, we find that, in general, on locally Fock-like (`Hadamard') representations: ( a) the Hamiltonians cannot be self-adjoint operators; ( b) the automorphisms of the field algebra generated by the evolution cannot be unitarily implemented; ( c) the expectation values of the Hamiltonians are well defined on a dense family of states; but ( d) these expectation values are unbounded below, even for evolution along future-directed timelike vector fields and even on Hadamard states. These are all local, ultraviolet, effects.},

It relies on the forward simulation of mock data and comparison between observed and synthetic catalogues. Here we present COSMOABC, a Python ABC sampler featuring a Population Monte Carlo variation of the original ABC algorithm, which uses an adaptive importance sampling scheme. The code is very flexible and can be easily coupled to an external simulator, while allowing to incorporate arbitrary distance and prior functions. As an example of practical application, we coupled COSMOABC with the NUMCOSMO library and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate posterior probability distributions over cosmological parameters based on measurements of galaxy clusters number counts without computing the likelihood function. COSMOABC is published under the GPLv3 license on PyPI and GitHub and documentation is available at http://goo.gl/SmB8EX.},

We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of 'roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.},

  Abstract                 = {We study cosmological perturbations in general inflation models with multiple scalar fields and arbitrary kinetic terms, with special emphasis on the multifield extension of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation. We compute the second-order action governing the dynamics of linear perturbations in the most general case. Specializing to DBI inflation, we show that the adiabatic and entropy modes propagate with a common effective sound speed and are thus amplified at sound horizon crossing. In the small sound speed limit, we find that the amplitude of the entropy modes is much higher than that of the adiabatic modes. We also derive, in the general case, the third-order action which is useful for studying primordial non-Gaussianities generated during inflation. In the DBI case, we compute the dominant contributions to non-Gaussianities, which depend on both the adiabatic and entropy modes.},

  abstract      = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) is a new accurate Boltzmann code, designed to offer a more user-friendly and flexible coding environment to cosmologists. CLASS is very structured, easy to modify, and offers a rigorous way to control the accuracy of output quantities. It is also incidentally a bit faster than other codes. In this overview, we present the general principles of CLASS and its basic structure. We insist on the friendliness and flexibility aspects, while accuracy, physical approximations and performances are discussed in a series of companion papers.},

  Abstract                 = {By confronting the two independent Boltzmann codes CLASS and CAMB, we establish that for concordance cosmology and for a given recombination history, lensed CMB and matter power spectra can be computed by current codes with an accuracy of 0.01%. We list a few tiny changes in CAMB which are necessary in order to reach such a level. Using the common limit of the two codes as a set of reference spectra, we derive precision settings corresponding to fixed levels of error in the computation of a CMB likelihood. We find that for a given precision level, CLASS is about 2.5 times faster than CAMB for computing the lensed CMB spectra of a LambdaCDM model. The nature of the main improvements in CLASS (which may each contribute to these performances) is discussed in companion papers.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new flexible, fast and accurate way to implement massive neutrinos, warm dark matter and any other non-cold dark matter relics in Boltzmann codes. For whatever analytical or numerical form of the phase-space distribution function, the optimal sampling in momentum space compatible with a given level of accuracy is automatically found by comparing quadrature methods. The perturbation integration is made even faster by switching to an approximate viscous fluid description inside the Hubble radius, which differs from previous approximations discussed in the literature. When adding one massive neutrino to the minimal cosmological model, CLASS becomes just 1.5 times slower, instead of about 5 times in other codes (for fixed accuracy requirements). We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by considering a few examples of standard or non-standard neutrinos, as well as warm dark matter models.},

  Abstract                 = {The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the new publicly available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 74 different models, a number that may be compared with three or four representing the present state of the art. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia Inflationaris. Finally, we discuss how this procedure and ASPIC could be used to determine the best model of inflation by means of Bayesian inference.},

  Abstract                 = {We study multifield contributions to the scalar power spectrum in an ensemble of six-field inflationary models obtained in string theory. We identify examples in which inflation occurs by chance, near an approximate inflection point, and we compute the primordial perturbations numerically, both exactly and using an array of truncated models. The scalar mass spectrum and the number of fluctuating fields are accurately described by a simple random matrix model. During the approach to the inflection point, bending trajectories and violations of slow roll are commonplace, and `many-field' effects, in which three or more fields influence the perturbations, are often important. However, in a large fraction of models consistent with constraints on the tilt the signatures of multifield evolution occur on unobservably large scales. Our scenario is a concrete microphysical realization of quasi-single-field inflation, with scalar masses of order H, but the cubic and quartic couplings are typically too small to produce detectable non-Gaussianity. We argue that our results are characteristic of a broader class of models arising from multifield potentials that are natural in the Wilsonian sense.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the features generated by a sharp turn along the inflationary trajectory in a two-field model of Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation, where one of the fields is heavy. Distinct features are generated by two different effects: the mixing of the light and heavy modes during the turn, on the one hand, and the resonance between the oscillations along the heavy direction after the turn, on the other hand. Contrary to models with standard kinetic terms, the resonance effect is not strongly suppressed because the action contains derivative interactions. Working in the potential basis, we study the oscillations after the turn and compute the amplitude of the mixing and resonance features in the power spectrum, as well as in the bispectrum for the latter effect. We find that the amplitudes and positions of these combined features obey specific consistency relations, which could be confronted with cosmological data.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents the Planck 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of the 2-point correlation functions of CMB temperature and polarization. They use the hybrid approach employed previously: pixel-based at low multipoles, $\ell$, and a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of cross-power spectra at higher $\ell$. The main improvements are the use of more and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more detailed foreground and instrumental models. More than doubling the data allows further checks and enhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a larger sky fraction, contributing to enhanced precision. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further reduce uncertainties. Extensive tests establish robustness and accuracy, from temperature, from polarization, and from their combination, and show that the {\Lambda}CDM model continues to offer a very good fit. We further validate the likelihood against specific extensions to this baseline, such as the effective number of neutrino species. For this first detailed analysis of Planck polarization, we concentrate at high $\ell$ on E modes. At low $\ell$ we use temperature at all Planck frequencies along with a subset of polarization. These data take advantage of Planck's wide frequency range to improve the separation of CMB and foregrounds. Within the baseline cosmology this requires a reionization optical depth $\tau=0.078\pm0.019$, significantly lower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring. At high $\ell$ we detect residual errors in E, typically at the {\mu}K$^2$ level; we thus recommend temperature alone as the high-$\ell$ baseline. Nevertheless, Planck high-$\ell$ polarization spectra are already good enough to allow a separate high-accuracy determination of the {\Lambda}CDM parameters, consistent with those established from temperature alone.},

  abstract      = {We calculate the scalar spectral index ns and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r in a class of recently proposed two-field no-scale inflationary models in supergravity. We show that, in order to obtain correct predictions, it is crucial to take into account the coupling between the curvature and the isocurvature perturbations induced by the noncanonical form of the kinetic terms. This coupling enhances the curvature perturbation and suppresses the resulting tensor-to-scalar ratio to the per mille level even for values of the slow-roll parameter epsilon ~ 0.01. Beyond these particular models, we emphasise that multifield models of inflation are a priori not predictive, unless one supplies a prescription for the post-inflationary era, or an adiabatic limit is reached before the end of inflation. We examine the conditions that enabled us to actually derive predictions in the models under study, by analysing the various contributions to the effective isocurvature mass in general two-field inflationary models. In particular, we point out a universal geometrical contribution that is important at the end of inflation, and which can be directly extracted from the inflationary Lagrangian, independently of a specific trajectory. Eventually, we point out that spectator fields can lead to oscillatory features in the time-dependent power spectra at the end of inflation. We demonstrate how these features can be model semi-analytically as well as the theoretical uncertainties they can entail.},

  abstract      = {We show the existence of a general mechanism by which heavy scalar fields can be destabilized during inflation. It relies on the fact that the effective mass of fluctuations orthogonal to the inflationary direction contains a contribution proportional to the curvature tensor of the field space metric, and that it can render the entropic fluctuations tachyonic. We describe a simple and rather universal setup in which apparently benign higher-order operators trigger this instability. This phenomenon can prematurely end inflation and have important observational consequences, sometimes excluding models that would otherwise perfectly fit the data. More generally, it modifies the interpretation of cosmological constraints in terms of fundamental physics.},

  abstract =      {We present and discuss a new approach increasing by orders of magnitude the speed of performing Bayesian inference and parameter estimation within the framework of slow-roll inflation. The method relies on the determination of an effective likelihood for inflation which is a function of the primordial amplitude of the scalar perturbations complemented with the necessary number of the so-called Hubble flow functions to reach the desired accuracy. Starting from any cosmological data set, the effective likelihood is obtained by marginalization over the standard cosmological parameters, here viewed as `nuisance' from the early Universe point of view. As being low dimensional, basic machine-learning algorithms can be trained to accurately reproduce its multidimensional shape and then be used as a proxy to perform fast Bayesian inference on the inflationary models. The robustness and accuracy of the method are illustrated using the Planck cosmic microwave background data to perform primordial parameter estimation for the large field models of inflation. In particular, marginalized over all possible reheating history, we find the power index of the potential to verify p < 2.3 at 95 per cent of confidence.},

  abstract =  {We consider the problem of evolving the state of a quantum field between any two (in general, curved) Cauchy surfaces. Classically, this dynamical evolution is represented by a canonical transformation on the phase space for the field theory. We show that this canonical transformation cannot, in general, be unitarily implemented on the Fock space for free quantum fields on flat spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. We do this by considering time evolution of a free Klein-Gordon field on a flat spacetime (with toroidal Cauchy surfaces) starting from a flat initial surface and ending on a generic final surface. The associated Bogolubov transformation is computed; it does not correspond to a unitary transformation on the Fock space. This means that functional evolution of the quantum state as originally envisioned by Tomonaga, Schwinger and Dirac is not a viable concept. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that functional evolution of the quantum state can be satisfactorily described using the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. We discuss possible implications of our results for canonical quantum gravity.},

  Abstract                 = {In terms of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, we develop field-theoretical models of quantum nonequilibrium systems which could exist today as relics from the very early Universe. We consider relic excited states generated by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes, for particle species that decoupled close to the Planck temperature. Simple estimates suggest that, at least in principle, quantum nonequilibrium could survive to the present day for some relic systems. The main focus of this paper is to describe the behavior of such systems in terms of field theory, with the aim of understanding how relic quantum nonequilibrium might manifest experimentally. We show by explicit calculation that simple perturbative couplings will transfer quantum nonequilibrium from one field to another (for example from the inflaton field to its decay products). We also show that fields in a state of quantum nonequilibrium will generate anomalous spectra for standard energy measurements. Possible connections to current astrophysical observations are briefly addressed.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that cosmological quantum relaxation predicts an anisotropic primordial power spectrum with a specific dependence on wavenumber k. We explore some of the consequences for precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Quantum relaxation is a feature of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, which allows the existence of more general physical states that violate the Born probability rule. Recent work has shown that relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes on expanding space, resulting in a large-scale power deficit with a characteristic inverse-tangent dependence on k. Because the quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave vector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able to derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined by the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB covariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the lowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling with multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual statistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency relation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the angular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the l-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation appears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale power deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with potentially testable relationships between them.},

  abstract      = {The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky lies in the precision with which we can calculate the cosmological recombination process. Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cosmological parameters derived from the Planck satellite, for example. Here, we modify the cosmological recombination code RECFAST by introducing one more parameter to reproduce the recent numerical results for the speed-up of the helium recombination. Together with the existing hydrogen fudge factor, we vary these two parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using the COSMOMC code with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than 10 per cent for HeI and 1 per cent for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological parameters. For helium recombination, if the existing studies have calculated the ionization fraction to the 0.1 per cent level by properly including the relevant physical processes, then we already have numerical calculations which are accurate enough for Planck. For hydrogen, setting the fudge factor to speed up low-redshift recombination by 14 per cent appears to be sufficient for Planck. However, more work still needs to be done to carry out comprehensive numerical calculations of all the relevant effects for hydrogen, as well as to check for effects which couple hydrogen and helium recombination through the radiation field.},

  abstract      = {The formalism to treat quantization and evolution of cosmological perturbations of multiple fluids is described. We first construct the Lagrangian for both the gravitational and matter parts, providing the necessary relevant variables and momenta leading to the quadratic Hamiltonian describing linear perturbations. The final Hamiltonian is obtained without assuming any equations of motions for the background variables. This general formalism is applied to the special case of two fluids, having in mind the usual radiation and matter mix which made most of our current Universe history. Quantization is achieved using an adiabatic expansion of the basis functions. This allows for an unambiguous definition of a vacuum state up to the given adiabatic order. Using this basis, we show that particle creation is well defined for a suitable choice of vacuum and canonical variables, so that the time evolution of the corresponding quantum fields is unitary. This provides constraints for setting initial conditions for an arbitrary number of fluids and background time evolution. We also show that the common choice of variables for quantization can lead to an ill-defined vacuum definition. Our formalism is not restricted to the case where the coupling between fields is small, but is only required to vary adiabatically with respect to the ultraviolet modes, thus paving the way to consistent descriptions of general models not restricted to single-field (or fluid).},

  abstract  = {The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy power on the largest
angular scales observed both by WMAP and COBE DMR appears to be lower
than the one predicted by the standard model of cosmology with almost
scale free primordial perturbations arising from a period of inflation.
One can either interpret this as a manifestation of cosmic variance or
as a physical effect that requires an explanation. We discuss various
mechanisms that could be responsible for the suppression of such low ell
multipoles. Features in the late time evolution of metric fluctuations
may do this via the integral Sachs Wolfe effect. Another possibility is
a suppression of power at large scales in the primordial spectrum
induced by a fast rolling stage in the evolution of the inflaton field
at the beginning of the last 65 e-folds of inflation. We illustrate this
effect in a simple model of inflation and fit the resulting CMB spectrum
to the observed temperature temperature (TT) power spectrum. We find
that the WMAP observations suggest a cutoff at k$_{c}$ =
4.9$^{+1.3}$$_{-1.6}$ {\times} 10$^{-4}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ at 68\% confidence, but only an upper limit of
k$_{c}$ $\lt$ 7.4 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at 95\%.
Thus, although it improves the fit of the data, the presence of a cutoff
in power spectrum is only required at a level close to 2sigma. This is
obtained with a prior which corresponds to equal distribution w.r.t.
k$_{c}$. We discuss how other choices (such as an equal
distribution w.r.t. lnk$_{c}$, which is natural in the context of
inflation) can affect the statistical interpretation.},

  abstract      = {We consider the construction of nonsingular Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic type cosmological models realized by the addition to the action of specific higher-order terms stemming from quantum corrections. We study models involving general relativity coupled to a single scalar field with a potential motivated by the Ekpyrotic scenario. We find that the inclusion of the string loop and quantum correction terms in the string frame makes it possible to obtain solutions of the variational equations which are nonsingular and bouncing in the Einstein frame, even when a negative exponential potential is present, as is the case in the Ekpyrotic scenario. We analyze the spectra of perturbations produced during the bouncing phase and find that the spectrum of curvature fluctuations in the model proposed originally to implement the Ekpyrotic scenario has a large blue tilt ({\$}n{\_}R= 3{\$}). Except for instabilities introduced on small scales, the result agrees with what is obtained by imposing continuity of the induced metric and of the extrinsic curvature across a constant scalar field (up to {\$}k{\^{}}2{\$} corrections equal to the constant energy density) matching surface between the contracting and the expanding Einstein Universes. We also discuss nonsingular cosmological solutions obtained when a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coefficient suitably dependent on the scalar matter field is added to the action in the Einstein frame with a potential for the scalar field present.},

The holographic dark energy with {\$}c{\textless}1{\$} can realize a quintom behavior; namely, it evolves from a quintessence-like component to a phantom-like one. The holographic phantom energy density grows rapidly and dominates the late-time expanding phase, helping realize a cyclic universe scenario in which the high energy regime is modified by the effects of quantum gravity, causing a turnaround (and a bounce) of the universe. The dynamical evolution of holographic dark energy in the regimes of low energy and high energy is governed by two differential equations, respectively. It is of importance to link the two regimes for this scenario. We propose a link condition giving rise to a complete picture of holographic evolution of a cyclic universe.},

The backgrounds studied to date do not yield a scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations. Here, we present a new contracting background model (neither of Pre-Big-Bang nor of the Ekpyrotic form) involving a single scalar field coupled to gravity in which a scale-invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations and gravitational waves results. The equation of state of this scalar field corresponds to cold matter. We demonstrate that if this contracting phase can be matched via a nonsingular bounce to an expanding Friedmann cosmology, the scale-invariance of the curvature fluctuations is maintained. We also find new background solutions for Pre-Big-Bang and for Ekpyrotic cosmology, which involve two scalar fields with exponential potentials with background values which are evolving in time. We comment on the difficulty of obtaining a scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations with background solutions which have been studied in the past.},

Within this framework, we present an analytical method to accurately estimate the spectrum of large-scale scalar perturbations until their reentry, long after the bounce. We also propose a simple way to identify non-singular gauge-invariant variables through the bounce and present the results of extensive numerical tests in several possible realizations of the scenario. In no case do we find that the spectrum of the pre-bounce growing mode of the Bardeen potential can be transferred to a post-bounce constant mode.},

This stable evolution cannot occur, however, if scale-invariant curvature perturbations are produced by the entropic mechanism because it requires two scalar fields (e.g., the radion and the Calabi-Yau dilaton) evolving along an unstable classical trajectory. In fact, we show here that an overwhelming fraction of the universe fails to make it through the ekpyrotic phase; nevertheless, a sufficient volume survives and cycling continues forever provided the dark energy phase of the cycle lasts long enough, of order a trillion years. Two consequences are a new role for dark energy and a global structure of the universe radically different from that of eternal inflation.},

These equations can be used to derive predictions for local bi- and trispectra of multi-field cosmological models. Our main application is to ekpyrotic models in which the primordial curvature perturbations are generated via the non-minimal entropic mechanism. In these models, nearly scale-invariant entropy perturbations are generated first due to a non-minimal kinetic coupling between two scalar fields, and subsequently these perturbations are converted into curvature perturbations. Remarkably, the entropy perturbations have vanishing bi- and trispectra during the ekpyrotic phase. However, as we show, the conversion process to curvature perturbations induces local non-Gaussianity parameters {\$}f{\_}{\{}NL{\}}{\$} and {\$}g{\_}{\{}NL{\}}{\$} at levels that should be detectable by near-future observations. In fact, in order to obtain a large enough amplitude and small enough bispectrum of the curvature perturbations, as seen in current measurements, the conversion process must be very efficient. Interestingly, for such efficient conversions the trispectrum parameter {\$}g{\_}{\{}NL{\}}{\$} remains negative and typically of a magnitude {\$}{\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(10{\^{}}2) - {\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(10{\^{}}3),{\$} resulting in a distinguishing feature of non-minimally coupled ekpyrotic models.},

We confirm the strong dependence on luminosity for both the profile and the amplitude of RCs. Spiral RCs show the striking feature that a single parameter, the luminosity, dictates the rotation velocity at any radius for all objects, so revealing the existence of a universal RC. At high luminosity, there is a slight discrepancy between the profiles of RCs and those predicted from the luminous matter (LM) distributions: this implies a small, yet detectable, amount of dark matter (DM). At low luminosities the failure of the LM prediction is most severe, and DM is the only relevant mass component. Some of the derived scaling properties between dark and luminous galactic structure parameters are: (a) the DM/LM mass ratio at the optical radius scales inversely with luminosity; (b) the halo core radius is comparable to the optical radius, but shrinks for lower luminosities; (c) the central halo density scales as L{\^{}}{\{}-0.7{\}}; (d) the halo virial mass scales as L{\^{}}{\{}0.5{\}}. Such scaling properties can be represented as a curve in the luminosity-(DM/LM ratio)-(DM core radius)-(central DM density) space, which acts as the spirals' counterpart to the FP of ellipticals.},

Employing a Bianchi I cosmological model, we obtain a "Schr$\backslash$"odinger-like" equation where the matter variables play de role of time. This equation has a hyperbolic signature. It can be explicitly solved and a wave packet is constructed. The expectation value of the scale factor, evaluated in the spirit of the many-worlds interpretation, reveals an isotropic Universe. On the other hand, the bohmian trajectories indicate the existence of anisotropies. This is an example where the Bohm-de Broglie and the many-worlds interpretations are not equivalent.

Our starting point is the bouncing cosmology investigated in Falciano et al. (2008), which we complete by a detailed study of the transfer of cosmological perturbations through the bounce and a discussion of possible observational effects of bouncing cosmologies. We focus on a symmetric bounce and compute the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the contracting, bouncing and inflationary phases. We derive an expression for the Mukhanov-Sasaki perturbation variable at the onset of the inflationary phase that follows the bounce. Rather than being in the Bunch-Davies vacuum, it is found to be in an excited state that depends on the time scale of the bounce. We then show that this induces oscillations superimposed on the nearly scale-invariant primordial spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations. We discuss the effects of these oscillations in the cosmic microwave background and in the matter power spectrum. We propose a new way to indirectly measure the spatial curvature energy density parameter in the context of this model.},

This allows us to investigate whether cyclic universe scenarios, like the ekpyrotic model, do indeed lead to isotropisation on approach to a singularity (or bounce) in the presence of dominant ultra-stiff pressure anisotropies. We specialise to consider the closed Bianchi type IX universe and show that when the anisotropic pressures are stiffer on average than any isotropic ultra-stiff fluid then, if they dominate on approach to the singularity, it will be anisotropic. We include an isotropic ultra-stiff ghost fluid with negative energy density in order to create a cosmological bounce at finite volume in the absence of the anisotropic fluid. When the dominant anisotropic fluid is present it leads to an anisotropic cosmological singularity rather than an isotropic bounce. The inclusion of anisotropic stresses generated by collisionless particles in an anisotropically expanding universe is therefore essential for a full analysis of the consequences of a cosmological bounce or singularity in cyclic universes.},

  abstract      = {We perform the study of the stability of the cosmological scalar field models, by using the Jacobi stability analysis, or the Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory. In the KCC approach we describe the time evolution of the scalar field cosmologies in geometric terms, by performing a "second geometrization", by considering them as paths of a semispray. By introducing a non-linear connection and a Berwald type connection associated to the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations, five geometrical invariants can be constructed, with the second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the cosmological model. We obtain all the relevant geometric quantities, and we formulate the condition of the Jacobi stability for scalar field cosmologies in the second order formalism. As an application of the developed methods we consider the Jacobi stability properties of the scalar fields with exponential and Higgs type potential. We find that the Universe dominated by a scalar field exponential potential is in Jacobi unstable state, while the cosmological evolution in the presence of Higgs fields has alternating stable and unstable phases. By using the standard first order formulation of the cosmological models as dynamical systems we have investigated the stability of the phantom quintessence and tachyonic scalar fields, by lifting the first order system to the tangent bundle. It turns out that in the presence of a power law potential both these models are Jacobi unstable during the entire cosmological evolution.},

This extended matter bounce scenario can be realized by considering a single scalar field evolving along an approximately exponential potential. Our result reveals that the rolling of the scalar field in general leads to a running behavior on the spectral index of primordial cosmological perturbations and a negative running can be realized in this model. We constrain the corresponding parameter space by using the newly released Planck data. To apply this scenario, we revisit bouncing cosmologies within the context of modified gravity theories, in particular, the holonomy corrected loop quantum cosmology and teleparallel {\$}F(T){\$} gravity. A gravitational process of reheating is presented in such a matter bounce scenario to demonstrate the condition of satisfying current observations. We also comment on several unresolved issues that often appear in matter bounce models.},

The bouncing phase, induced by ghost condensation, is designed to produce a classically nonsingular bounce at a finite value of the scale factor. We show that the initial curvature and anisotropy, though diluted during the ekpyrotic phase, grow back exponentially during the bouncing phase. Moreover, curvature perturbations and anisotropy are generated by quantum fluctuations during the ekpyrotic phase. In the bouncing phase, however, an adiabatic curvature perturbation grows to dominate and contributes a blue spectrum that spoils the scale-invariance. Meanwhile, a scalar shear perturbation grows nonlinear and creates an overwhelming anisotropy that disrupts the nonsingular bounce altogether.},

Such deviations are theoretically possible in the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics, according to which the Born rule describes a state of statistical equilibrium. We suggest that a stable equilibrium state can exist only in restricted conditions: on a classical background spacetime that is globally hyperbolic or in a mild quantum-gravity regime in which there is an effective Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation with a well-defined time parameter. These arguments suggest that quantum equilibrium will be unstable at the Planck scale. We construct a model in which quantum nonequilibrium is generated by a time-dependent regulator for pilot-wave dynamics, where the regulator is introduced to eliminate phase singularities. Applying our model to trans-Planckian modes that exit the Planck radius, we calculate the corrected primordial power spectrum and show that it displays a power excess (above a critical wavenumber). We briefly consider how our proposals could be tested by measurements of the cosmic microwave background.},

Not only has it radically altered the way we view the universe, but the theory also has a considerable number of surprises in store. This is especially so in the three main topics of current interest that this book reaches, namely: black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology. The main aim of this textbook is to provide students with a sound mathematical introduction coupled to an understandingof the physical insights needed to explore the subject. Indeed, the book follows Einstein in that it introduces the theory very much from a physical point of view. After introducing the special theory of relativity, the basic field equations of gravitation are derived and discussed carefully as a prelude to first solving them in simple cases and then exploring the three main areas of application. Einstein's theory of relativity is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of the humanmind. Yet, in this book, the author makes it possible for students with a wide range of abilities to deal confidently with the subject. Based on the author's fifteen years experience of teaching this subject, this is achieved by breaking down the main arguments into simple logical steps. The book includes numerous illustrative diagrams and exercises (of varying degrees of difficulty), and as a result this book makes an excellent course for any student coming to the subject for the first time.},

  abstract      = {This article describes the theory of cosmological perturbations around a homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the Bianchi I type. Starting from a general parameterisation of the perturbed spacetime a la Bardeen, a complete set of gauge invariant variables is constructed. Three physical degrees of freedom are identified and it is shown that, in the case where matter is described by a scalar field, they generalize the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. In order to show that they are canonical variables, the action for the cosmological perturbations at second order is derived. Two major physical imprints of the primordial anisotropy are identified: (1) a scalar-tensor ``see-saw'' mechanism arising from the fact that scalar, vector and tensor modes do not decouple and (2) an explicit dependence of the statistical properties of the density perturbations and gravity waves on the wave-vector instead of its norm. This analysis extends, but also sheds some light on, the quantization procedure that was developed under the assumption of a Friedmann-Lemaitre background spacetime, and allows to investigate the robustness of the predictions of the standard inflationary scenario with respect to the hypothesis on the symmetries of the background spacetime. These effects of a primordial anisotropy may be related to some anomalies of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies on large angular scales.},

  abstract      = {Assuming that curvature perturbations and gravitational waves originally arise from vacuum fluctuations in a matter-dominated phase of contraction, we study the dynamics of the cosmological perturbations evolving through a nonsingular bouncing phase described by a generic single scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. In order for such a model to be consistent with the current upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, there must be an enhancement of the curvature fluctuations during the bounce phase. We show that, while it remains possible to enlarge the amplitude of curvature perturbations due to the nontrivial background evolution, this growth is very limited because of the conservation of curvature perturbations on super-Hubble scales. We further perform a general analysis of the evolution of primordial non-Gaussianities through the bounce phase. By studying the general form of the bispectrum we show that the non-Gaussianity parameter {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}NL{\}}{\}}{\$} (which is of order unity before the bounce phase) is enhanced during the bounce phase if the curvature fluctuations grow. Hence, in such nonsingular bounce models with matter given by a single scalar field, there appears to be a tension between obtaining a small enough tensor-to-scalar ratio and not obtaining a value of {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}NL{\}}{\}}{\$} in excess of the current upper bounds. This conclusion may be considered as a "no-go" theorem that rules out any single field matter bounce cosmology starting with vacuum initial conditions for the fluctuations.},

  abstract      = {We examine the dynamics of a Bianchi IX model on a 4-dim brane embedded in a 5-dim conformally flat empty bulk with a timelike extra dimension. Einstein's equations on the brane reduces to a 6-dim Hamiltonian dynamical system with additional terms that implement nonsingular bounces in the model. The phase space of the model has two critical points (a saddle-center-center and a center-center-center) in a finite region of phase space, and two asymptotic de Sitter critical points, one acting as an attractor to late-time dynamics. The saddle-center-center engenders in the phase space the topology of stable and unstable 4-dim cylinders {\{}{\$}{\}}R \backslashbackslashtimes S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}, where {\{}{\$}{\}}R{\{}{\$}{\}} is a saddle direction and {\{}{\$}{\}}S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}} is the center manifold of unstable periodic orbits (the nonlinear extension of the center-center sector). By a proper canonical transformation we separate the degrees of freedom of the dynamics into one degree connected with the expansion/contraction of the scales of the model, and two rotational degrees of freedom connected to the {\{}{\$}{\}}S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}. The typical dynamical flow is then an oscillatory mode about a neighborhood of the cylinders. For the stable and unstable cylinders the oscillatory motion about the separatrix towards the bounce leads to the homoclinic transversal intersection of the cylinders, as shown numerically in two distinct experiments. We show that the homoclinic intersection manifold has the topology of {\{}{\$}{\}}R \backslashbackslashtimes S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}} consisting of homoclinic orbits biasymptotic to the center manifold {\{}{\$}{\}}S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}. This behavior defines a {\{}{\{}{\}}{\$}\backslash{\$}it chaotic saddle{\{}{\}}{\}} associated with {\{}{\$}{\}}S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}, indicating that the intersection points of the cylinders have the nature of a Cantor set with a compact support {\{}{\$}{\}}S{\{}{\^{}}{\}}2{\{}{\$}{\}}, characterizing chaos in the model. We discuss the oscillatory approach to the bounce together with its chaotic behavior, and analogous features present in the BKL conjecture in general relativity.},

  abstract      = {We extend the Loop Quantum Cosmology matter bounce scenario in order to include a dark energy era, which ends abruptly at a Rip singularity where the scale factor and the Hubble rate diverge. In the "deformed matter bounce scenario", the Universe is contracting from an initial non-causal matter dominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a decelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way, thus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter dominated era. Depending on the choice of the free parameters of the model, the dark energy era is quintessential like which follows the matter domination era, and eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the end of the dark energy era, a Rip singularity exists, where the scale factor and Hubble rate diverge, however the physical system cannot reach the singularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex. This indicates two things, firstly that the ordinary Loop Quantum Cosmology matter bounce evolution stops, thus ending the infinite repetition of the ordinary matter bounce scenario. Secondly, the fact that both the pressure and the density become complex indicates probably that the description of the cosmic evolution within the theoretical context of Loop Quantum Cosmology, ceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be Rip singularity. We describe the qualitative features of the model and we also investigate how this cosmology could be realized by a viscous fluid and scalar field in the context of LQC.},

Power-law kinetic-potential scaling solutions are the late-time attractor in a collapsing universe for steep negative potentials (the ekpyrotic scenario) and stable against matter, curvature or shear perturbations. Otherwise kinetic-dominated solutions are the attractor during collapse (the pre big bang scenario) and are only marginally stable with respect to anisotropic shear.},

We show that the consistent histories approach can give a precise answer to the question concerning the existence of a quantum bounce if and only if one takes the single frequency approach and within a single family of histories, namely, a family containing histories concerning properties of the quantum system at only two specific moments of time: the infinity past and the infinity future. In that case, as shown by Craig and Singh $\backslash$cite{\{}CS{\}}, there is no quantum bounce. In any other situation, the question concerning the existence of a quantum bounce has no meaning in the consistent histories approach. On the contrary, we show that if one considers the de Broglie-Bohm theory, there are always states where quantum bounces occur in both quantization schemes. Hence the assertion that the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization does not solve the singularity problem in cosmology is not precise. To address this question, one must specify not only the quantum interpretation adopted but also the quantization scheme chosen.},

The model we use in this work has a cosmological constant and the matter content is dust. To this model we add a quantum-inspired potential that is intended to represent short-range effects due to the general relativistic behavior of matter in small scales and play the role of a repulsive force near the singularity. We find that this potential restricts the dynamics of the model to positive values of {\{}{\$}{\}}A(t){\{}{\$}{\}} and {\{}{\$}{\}}B(t){\{}{\$}{\}} and alters some qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the dynamics studied previously by several authors. We make a complete analysis of the phase space of the model finding critical points, periodic orbits, stable/unstable manifolds using numerical techniques such as Poincar{\$}\backslash{\$}'e section, numerical continuation of orbits and numerical globalization of invariant manifolds. We compare the classical and the quantum models. Our main result is the existence of homoclinic crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds in the physically meaningful region of the phase space (where both {\{}{\$}{\}}A(t){\{}{\$}{\}} and {\{}{\$}{\}}B(t){\{}{\$}{\}} are positive), indicating chaotic escape to inflation and bouncing near the singularity.},

  abstract      = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2{\%} around the first acoustic peak.},

We obtain the model parameters by making a fit to TT correlations in CMBR data. Using these parameters we predict the signature of our models for correlations among different multipoles for the case of the TE and EE modes.

The local number density could be greater than this by a factor of up to 10{\^{}}6 if the black holes were clustered in the halos of galaxies. The best prospect for detecting a primordial black hole seems to be to look for the burst of hard gamma-rays that would be expected in the final stages of the evaporation of the black hole.

A number of models in which the energy density of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner are studied. In these models the current epoch is chosen to be scalar-field dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density parameter, $\Omega$dyn{\~{}}0.2, and zero spatial curvature. The required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear'' and decreases in magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special solution of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests of gravitation theory. The E{\"{o}}tv{\"{o}}s-Dicke measurements strongly constrain the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational) fields. Nucleosynthesis proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model. In linear perturbation theory the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in the baryon-dominated epoch, do not differ significantly from the canonical scenario, while the presence of a substantial amount of homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated epochs. On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial curvature preferred by inflation.},

Therefore low redshift observations could provide evidence for, or even falsify, various bouncing models. We provide an example where a recently hinted potential deviation from {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}-cold-dark-matter cosmology results from a dark matter and dark energy interaction. The same interaction allows matter bounce models to generate a red tilt for the primordial curvature perturbations in corroboration with cosmic microwave background experiments.},

We then construct a theory which, in addition to possessing a Poincar$\backslash$'e-invariant vacuum, does admit such a solution. For a wide range of parameters, perturbations around this solution are at all times stable, comfortably subluminal and weakly-coupled. The theory requires us to explicitly break dilation-invariance, so it is unlikely that the theory is fully stable under quantum corrections, but we argue that the existence of a healthy interpolating solution is quantum-mechanically robust.},

Formulated in a Friedmannian cosmological modelling framework based upon the cosmological ``principle'' hypothesis, this interpretation has given rise to the ``concordance'' model. However, a caveat of such a reasoning is that the cosmological ``principle'' derives from a philosophical Copernican assumption and has never been tested. Furthermore, a weakness of its conclusion, i. e., the existence of a negative-pressure fluid or a cosmological constant, is that it would have profound implications for the current theories of physics. This is why we have proposed a more conservative explanation, ascribing the departure of the observed universe from an Einstein-de Sitter model to the influence of inhomogeneities. This idea has been independently developed by other authors and further enlarged to the reproduction of different cosmological data. We review here the main proposals which have been put forward to deal with this purpose and present some prospects for future developments.},

  abstract      = {A Universe filled with a homogeneous scalar field exhibits `Cosmological hysteresis'. Cosmological hysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state during expansion and contraction. This asymmetry results in the formation of a hysteresis loop: {\$}\backslashoint pdV{\$}, whose value can be non-vanishing during each oscillatory cycle. For flat potentials, a negative value of the hysteresis loop leads to the increase in amplitude of consecutive cycles and to a universe with older and larger successive cycles. Such a universe appears to possess an arrow of time even though entropy production is absent and all of the equations respect time-reversal symmetry ! Cosmological hysteresis appears to be widespread and exists for a large class of scalar field potentials and mechanisms for making the universe bounce. For steep potentials, the value of the hysteresis loop can be positive as well as negative. The expansion factor in this case displays quasi-periodic behaviour in which successive cycles can be both larger as well as smaller than previous ones. This quasi-regular pattern resembles the phenomenon of BEATS displayed by acoustic systems. Remarkably, the expression relating the increase/decrease in oscillatory cycles to the quantum of hysteresis appears to be model independent. The cyclic scenario is extended to spatially anisotropic models and it is shown that the anisotropy density decreases during successive cycles if the hysteresis loop is negative.},

By using an appropriate form for the metric, one finds that the constraint equations for these models can be solved explicitly, and the resulting problem in Hamiltonian mechanics resembles that of a particle in a potential well. The most unusual feature of the Hamiltonian is that it is explicitly time dependent. There is an easy and attractive choice of factor orderings which allows one to pass on to a quantum theory (by imposing canonical commutation relations on the independent canonical variables) while maintaining the signature of the quantized metric. For the closed-space cosmological model (Bianchi type IX) which is studied in most detail, a classical (high-quantum-number) state remains classical as the wave function is followed back in time toward the initial singularity. There is no tendency for significant contributions from states of low quantum number to develop even when the radius of the universe is much less than (G?c3)12=10-33 cm.},

By combining this with a ghost condensate, the theory explicitly violates the null energy condition without developing any ghost-like instabilities. Thus the contracting universe goes through a non-singular bounce and evolves smoothly into the expanding post big bang phase. The curvature perturbation acquires a scale-invariant spectrum well before the bounce in this scenario. It is sourced by the scale-invariant entropy perturbation engendered by two ekpyrotic scalar fields, a mechanism recently proposed by Lehners et al. Since the background geometry is non-singular at all times, the curvature perturbation remains nearly constant on super horizon scales. It emerges from the bounce unscathed and imprints a scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations in the matter-radiation fluid at the onset of the hot big bang phase. The ekpyrotic potential can be chosen so that the spectrum has a ``red'' tilt, in accordance with the recent data from WMAP. As in the original Ekpyrotic scenario, the model predicts a negligible gravity wave signal on all observable scales. As such ``New Ekpyrotic Cosmology" provides a consistent and distinguishable alternative to inflation to account for the origin of the seeds of large scale structure.},

  abstract      = {We propose a theoretically consistent modification of gravity in the infrared, which is compatible with all current experimental observations. This is an analog of Higgs mechanism in general relativity, and can be thought of as arising from ghost condensation--a background where a scalar field $\backslash$phi has a constant velocity, {\textless}$\backslash$dot$\backslash$phi{\textgreater} = M{\^{}}2. The ghost condensate is a new kind of fluid that can fill the universe, which has the same equation of state, $\backslash$rho = -p, as a cosmological constant, and can hence drive de Sitter expansion of the universe. However, unlike a cosmological constant, it is a physical fluid with a physical scalar excitation, which can be described by a systematic effective field theory at low energies. The excitation has an unusual low-energy dispersion relation $\backslash$omega{\^{}}2 $\backslash$sim k{\^{}}4 / M{\^{}}2. If coupled to matter directly, it gives rise to small Lorentz-violating effects and a new long-range 1/r{\^{}}2 spin dependent force. In the ghost condensate, the energy that gravitates is not the same as the particle physics energy, leading to the possibility of both sources that can gravitate and antigravitate. The Newtonian potential is modified with an oscillatory behavior starting at the distance scale M{\_}{\{}Pl{\}}/M{\^{}}2 and the time scale M{\_}{\{}Pl{\}}{\^{}}2/M{\^{}}3. This theory opens up a number of new avenues for attacking cosmological problems, including inflation, dark matter and dark energy.},

The motivation of this theory is to investigate a possible non-minimal coupling of the matter fields to geometry which, being proportional to the curvature scalar, may represent an effective description of quantum gravity effects. Non-conservation of the stress-energy tensor, via Bianchi identities, implies new field equations which have been recently used in a cosmological context, leading to some interesting results. In this paper we adopt Rastall's theory to reproduce some features of the effective Friedmann's equation emerging from loop quantum cosmology. We determine a class of bouncing cosmological solutions and comment about the possibility of employing these models as effective descriptions of the full quantum theory.},

The potential for the ghost condensate field can be chosen such that the cosmological bounce is stable against the presence of anisotropic stress. Cosmological fluctuations on long wavelengths relevant to current cosmological observations pass through the bounce unaffected by the new physics which yields the bounce. Thus, this model allows for the realization of the "matter bounce" scenario, an alternative to inflationary cosmology for the generation of the observed primordial fluctuations in which the inhomogeneities originate as quantum vacuum perturbations which exit the Hubble radius in the matter-dominated phase of contraction.},

Some propose turning instead to a "postmodern" inflationary paradigm in which the cosmological properties in our observable universe are only locally valid and set randomly, with completely different properties (and perhaps even different physical laws) existing in most regions outside our horizon. By contrast, the new results are consistent with the simplest versions of ekpyrotic cyclic models in which the universe is smoothed and flattened during a period of slow contraction followed by a bounce, and another promising bouncing theory, anamorphic cosmology, has been proposed that can produce distinctive predictions.},

In the framework of minisuperspace models, we show how quantum cosmological effects in the de-Broglie-Bohm's approach can avoid the initial singularity, and isotropize the Universe. We then extend minisuperspace in order to include linear cosmological perturbations. We present the main equations which govern the dynamics of quantum cosmological perturbations evolving in non-singular quantum cosmological backgrounds, and calculate some of their observational consequences. These results are not known how to be obtained in other approaches to quantum theory. In the general case of full superspace, we enumerate the possible structures of quantum space and time that emerge from the de Broglie-Bohm picture. Finally, we compare some of the results coming from the de Broglie-Bohm theory with other approaches, and discuss the physical reasons for some discrepancies that occur.},

The former may be dealt with trivially in this formalism. The latter arise due to the presence of function-type ("gauge") group invariances. In order to eliminate these variables one must make use of the group transformations themselves.

However, in order to make this assertion, one must specify the underlying interpretation of quantum mechanics which has been adopted. For instance, several nonsingular models were obtained in Wheeler-DeWitt quantum cosmology in the framework of the de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory. Conversely, there are specific situations where the singularity cannot be avoided in the framework of the Consistent Histories approach to quantum mechanics. In these specific situations, the matter content is described by a scalar field, and the Wheeler-DeWitt equation looks-like a Klein-Gordon equation. The aim of this work is to study the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of cosmological models where the matter content is described by an hydrodynamical perfect fluid, where the Wheeler-DeWitt equation reduces to a genuine Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation. In this case, it is shown that the conclusions of the Consistent Histories and the de Broglie-Bohm approaches coincide in the quantum cosmological models where the curvature of the spatial sections is not positive definite, namely, that the cosmological singularities are eliminated. In the case of positive spatial curvature, the family of histories is no longer consistent, and no conclusion can be given in this framework.},

The Problem of Time is that `time' in GR and `time' in ordinary quantum theory are mutually incompatible notions, which is problematic in trying to put these two theories together to form a theory of Quantum Gravity. Four frontiers to this resolution in full GR are identified, alongside three further directions not yet conquered even for the relational triangle.   This article is also the definitive review on relational particle models originally due to Barbour (2003: dynamics of pure shape) and Barbour and Bertotti (1982: dynamics of shape and scale). These are exhibited as useful toy models of background independence, which I argue to be the `other half' of GR to relativistic gravitation, as well as the originator of the Problem of Time itself. Barbour's work and my localized extension of it are shown to be the classical precursor of the background independence that then manifests itself at the quantum level as the full-blown Problem of Time. In fact 7/8ths of the Isham--Kuchar Problem of Time facets are already present in classical GR; even classical mechanics in relational particle mechanics formulation exhibits 5/8ths of these! In addition to Isham, Kuchar and Barbour, the other principal authors whose works are drawn upon in building this Problem of Time approach are Kendall (relational models only: pure-shape configuration spaces), Dirac, Teitelboim and Halliwell (Problem of Time resolving components). The recommended scheme is a combination of the Machian semiclassical approach, histories theory and records theory.},

The underlying idea for such discussions is that although inflation already passed quite a large number of tests, indeed enough to make it part of the so-called ``standard model'' of cosmology, it has always been through indirect measurements: there is not a chance that we may ever directly check its validity, and therefore, in order to assert its factuality with increasing level of confidence, it is required that we compare its predictions not only to observations, but also to as many contenders as possible. Among other categories of possible models, we wish to put the emphasis in particular on bouncing cosmologies that, however not as complete as the inflation paradigm might be, could still represent a reasonnable way of explaining the current data. Hopefully, future data will be able to discriminate between these various sets of theories.},

  abstract      = {A fundamental assumption in the standard model of cosmology is that the Universe is isotropic on large scales. Breaking this assumption leads to a set of solutions to Einstein's field equations, known as Bianchi cosmologies, only a subset of which have ever been tested against data. For the first time, we consider all degrees of freedom in these solutions to conduct a general test of isotropy using cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data from Planck. For the vector mode (associated with vorticity), we obtain a limit on the anisotropic expansion of ($\sigma${\_}{\{}V{\}}/H){\_}{\{}0{\}}{\textless}4.7×10{\^{}}{\{}-11{\}} (95{\%} C.L.), which is an order of magnitude tighter than previous Planck results that used cosmic microwave background temperature only. We also place upper limits on other modes of anisotropic expansion, with the weakest limit arising from the regular tensor mode, ($\sigma${\_}{\{}T,reg{\}}/H){\_}{\{}0{\}}{\textless}1.0×10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}} (95{\%} C.L.). Including all degrees of freedom simultaneously for the first time, anisotropic expansion of the Universe is strongly disfavored, with odds of 121?000:1 against.},

  abstract      = {We investigate non-singular bounce realizations in the framework of ghost-free generalized Galileon cosmology, which furthermore can be free of the anisotropy problem. Considering an Ekpyrotic-like potential we can obtain a total Equation-of-State (EoS) larger than one in the contracting phase, which is necessary for the evolution to be stable against small anisotropic fluctuations. Since such a large EoS forbids the Galileon field to generate the desired form of perturbations, we additionally introduce the curvaton field which can in general produce the observed nearly scale-invariant spectrum. In particular, we provide approximate analytical and exact semi-analytical expressions under which the bouncing scenario is consistent with observations. Finally, the combined Galileon-curvaton system is free of the Big-Rip after the bounce.},

  abstract      = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10?21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1$\sigma$. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160?180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03?0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5?4M? and 29+4?4M?, and the final black hole mass is 62+4?4M?, with 3.0+0.5?0.5M?c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90{\%} credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

The presence of a non-singular bounce in a spatially flat universe implies a temporary violation of the null energy condition, which can be achieved through a phase of ghost condensation. We calculate the scale of strong coupling and demonstrate that the ghost-condensate bounce remains trustworthy throughout, and that all perturbation modes within the regime of validity of the effective description remain under control. For this purpose we require the perturbed action up to third order in perturbations, which we calculate in both flat and co-moving gauge -- since these two gauges allow us to highlight different physical aspects. Our conclusion is that there exist healthy descriptions of non-singular bouncing cosmologies providing a viable resolution of the big-bang singularities in cosmological models. Our results also suggest a variant of ekpyrotic cosmology, in which entropy perturbations are generated during the contracting phase, but are only converted into curvature perturbations after the bounce.},

The collapse dynamics of three different families of initial perturbation shapes, imposed at the time of horizon crossing, is computed. The perturbation threshold for black hole formation, needed for estimations of the cosmological PBH mass function, is found to be delta{\_}c {\~{}} 0.7 rather than the generally employed delta{\_}c {\~{}} 1/3 if delta is defined as Delta M/M{\_}h , the relative excess mass within the initial horizon volume. In order to study the accretion onto the newly formed black holes, we use a numerical scheme that allows us to follow the evolution for long times after formation of the event horizon. In general, small black holes (compared to the horizon mass at the onset of the collapse) give rise to a fluid bounce that effectively shuts off accretion onto the black hole, while large ones do not. In both cases, the growth of the black hole mass owing to accretion is insignificant. Furthermore, the scaling of black hole mass with the distance from the formation threshold, known to occur in near-critical gravitational collapse, is demonstrated to apply to primordial black hole formation.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we study possible observational consequences of the bouncing cosmology. We consider a model where a phase of inflation is preceded by a cosmic bounce. While we consider in this paper only that the bounce is due to loop quantum gravity, most of the results presented here can be applied for different bouncing cosmologies. We concentrate on the scenario where the scalar field, as the result of contraction of the universe, is driven from the bottom of the potential well. The field is amplified, and finally the phase of the standard slow-roll inflation is realized. Such an evolution modifies the standard inflationary spectrum of perturbations by the additional oscillations and damping on the large scales. We extract the parameters of the model from the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In particular, the value of inflaton mass is equal to {\$}m=(2.6 \backslashpm 0.6) \backslashcdot 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} GeV. In our considerations we base on the seven years of observations made by the WMAP satellite. We propose the new observational consistency check for the phase of slow-roll inflation. We investigate the conditions which have to be fulfilled to make the observations of the Big Bounce effects possible. We translate them to the requirements on the parameters of the model and then put the observational constraints on the model. Based on assumption usually made in loop quantum cosmology, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter was shown to be constrained by {\$}\backslashgamma{\textless}1100{\$} from the cosmological observations. We have compared the Big Bounce model with the standard Big Bang scenario and showed that the present observational data is not informative enough to distinguish these models.},

Given a bouncing cosmological background with inflation driven by the kinetic energy of the dilaton field, we obtain numerically the final power spectra generated from the vacuum quantum fluctuations of the metric and the dilaton field during inflation. Our result shows that both Bardeen's potential, {\$}\backslashPhi(\backslasheta,k){\$}, and the curvature perturbation in the uniform curvature gauge, {\$}{\{}\backslashmathcal R{\}}(\backslasheta,k){\$}, lead to a blue spectral distribution long after the transition.},

Performing a global fitting, we utilize this possibility to derive a novel method for constraining bounce parameters via cosmological measurements. Combining the CMB, LSS and SNIa data, our result interestingly reveals that a nonsingular bounce, if exists, should be a fast bounce which happens at a very high energy scale, as we get an upper limit on the bounce parameters.},

Specifically, we construct the decoherence functional for the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with a free, massless, minimally coupled scalar field, thus providing a complete decoherent histories formulation for this quantum cosmological model. The decoherence functional is applied to study predictions concerning the model's Dirac (relational) observables; the behavior of semiclassical states and superpositions of such states; and to study the singular behavior of quantum Wheeler-DeWitt universes. Within this framework, rigorous formulae are given for calculating the corresponding probabilities from the wave function when those probabilities may be consistently defined, thus replacing earlier heuristics for interpreting the wave function of the universe with explicit constructions. It is shown according to a rigorously formulated standard, and in a quantum-mechanically consistent way, that in this quantization these models are generically singular. Independent of the choice of state we show that the probability for these Wheeler-DeWitt quantum universes to ever encounter a singularity is unity. In addition, the relation between histories formulations of quantum theory and relational Dirac observables is clarified.},

Since this scenario depends on the presence of a bounce, it seems appropriate to consider it in the context of loop quantum cosmology where a bouncing universe naturally arises. For a pressureless collapsing universe in loop quantum cosmology, the predicted power spectrum of the scalar perturbations after the bounce is scale-invariant and the tensor to scalar ratio is negligibly small. A slight red tilt can be given to the scale-invariance of the scalar perturbations by a scalar field whose equation of state is {\$}P = - \backslashepsilon \backslashrho{\$}, where {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is a small positive number. Then, the power spectrum for tensor perturbations is also almost scale-invariant with the same red tilt as the scalar perturbations, and the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be {\$}r \backslashapprox 9 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}. Finally, for the predicted amplitude of the scalar perturbations to agree with observations, the critical density in loop quantum cosmology must be of the order {\$}\backslashrho{\_}c \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-9{\}} \backslashrho{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Pl{\}}{\$}.},

This theory is an alternative to standard quantum theory that provides an objective description of physical reality, where rather ambiguous notions of measurement or observer play no fundamental role, and which can hence be applied to the Universe as a whole. In addition, it allows for a simple and unambiguous characterization of the classical limit.},

cosmic contraction phase before the bounce into the current expansion
phase. For a nonsingular bounce, curvature and anisotropy grow rapidly
during the bouncing phase, raising questions about the reliability of
perturbative analysis. In this paper, we study the evolution of
adiabatic perturbations in a nonsingular bounce by nonperturbative
methods including numerical simulations of the nonsingular bounce and
the covariant formalism for calculating nonlinear perturbations. We show
that the bounce is disrupted in regions of the universe with significant
inhomogeneity and anisotropy over the background energy density but is
achieved in regions that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic.
Sufficiently small perturbations, consistent with observational
constraints, can pass through the nonsingular bounce with negligible
alteration from nonlinearity. We follow scale invariant perturbations
generated in a matterlike contraction phase through the bounce. Their
amplitude in the expansion phase is determined by the growing mode in
the contraction phase, and the scale invariance is well preserved across
the bounce.},

  abstract      = {Analyzing quantum cosmological scenarios containing one scalar field with exponential potential, we have obtained a universe model which realizes a classical dust contraction from very large scales, the initial repeller of the model, and moves to a stiff matter contraction near the singularity, which is avoided due to a quantum bounce. The universe is then launched in a stiff matter expanding phase, which then moves to a dark energy era, finally returning to the dust expanding phase, the final attractor of the model. Hence one has obtained a nonsingular cosmological model where a single scalar field can describe both the matter contracting phase of a bouncing model, necessary to give an almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations, and a transient expanding dark energy phase. As the universe is necessarily dust dominated in the far past, usual adiabatic vacuum initial conditions can be easily imposed in this era, avoiding the usual issues appearing when dark energy is considered in bouncing models.},

quantum mechanics is generalized to yield conditional probabilities for
selected sequences of events at several different times, called
``consistent histories,'' through a criterion which ensures that, within
limits which are explicitly defined within the formalism, classical
rules for probabilities are satisfied. The interpretive scheme which
results is applicable to closed (isolated) quantum systems, is
explicitly independent of the sense of time (i.e., past and future can
be interchanged), has no need for wave function ``collapse,'' makes no
reference to processes of measurement (though it can be used to analyze
such processes), and can be applied to sequences of microscopic or
macroscopic events, or both, as long as the mathematical condition of
consistency is satisfied. When applied to appropriate macroscopic events
it appears to yield the same answers as other interpretative schemes for
standard quantum mechanics, though from a different point of view which
avoids the conceptual difficulties which are sometimes thought to
require reference to conscious observers or classical apparatus.},

suggested that a nonlinear term be added to the Schr{\"o}dinger
equation, which rapidly drives the amplitude of one or another of the
state vectors in such a superposition to one, and the rest to zero. It
is proposed that it is the phase angles of the amplitudes immediately
after a measurement which determine which amplitude is driven to one. A
diffusion equation is arrived at to describe the reduction of an
ensemble of state vectors corresponding to an ensemble of
macroscopically identically prepared experiments. Then a nonlinear term
to add to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is presented, and it is shown
that this leads to the diffusion equation in a weak-coupling
approximation.},

  abstract      = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble
constant from 3.3\% to 2.4\%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new
near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host
galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the
sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a
total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation
based on {\tilde}300 SNe Ia at z $\lt$ 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the
megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical
and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the
relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements
include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser
distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on
late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of
Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky
Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of
Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15
MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial
scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant
from each is 72.25 {\plusmn} 2.51, 72.04 {\plusmn} 2.67, 76.18 {\plusmn}
2.37, and 74.50 {\plusmn} 3.27 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Our best estimate of H
$_{0}$ = 73.24 {\plusmn} 1.74 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC,
yielding a 2.4\% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully
propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is
3.4{$\sigma$} higher than 66.93 {\plusmn} 0.62 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ predicted by {$\Lambda$}CDM with 3 neutrino flavors
having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy
reduces to 2.1{$\sigma$} relative to the prediction of 69.3 {\plusmn} 0.7 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ based on the comparably
precise combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that
systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role
in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift
measurements and our local determination of H $_{0}$ at face
value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of
dark radiation in the early universe in the range of {$\Delta$}N
$_{eff}$ {\ap} 0.4-1. We anticipate further significant
improvements in H $_{0}$ from upcoming parallax measurements of
long-period MW Cepheids.

  abstract      = {We create a sample of spectroscopically identified galaxies with $z < 0.2$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7, covering 6813 deg$^2$. Galaxies are chosen to sample the highest mass haloes, with an effective bias of 1.5, allowing us to construct 1000 mock galaxy catalogs (described in Paper II), which we use to estimate statistical errors and test our methods. We use an estimate of the gravitational potential to "reconstruct" the linear density fluctuations, enhancing the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal in the measured correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting to these measurements, we determine $D_{V}(z_{\rm eff}=0.15) = (664\pm25)(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ Mpc; this is a better than 4 per cent distance measurement. This "fills the gap" in BAO distance ladder between previously measured local and higher redshift measurements, and affords significant improvement in constraining the properties of dark energy. Combining our measurement with other BAO measurements from BOSS and 6dFGS galaxy samples provides a 15 per cent improvement in the determination of the equation of state of dark energy and the value of the Hubble parameter at $z=0$ ($H_0$). Our measurement is fully consistent with the Planck results and the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, but increases the tension between Planck$+$BAO $H_0$ determinations and direct $H_0$ measurements.},

some other form of `dark energy'. This dark energy now appears to
dominate the Universe and not only alters its expansion rate, but also
affects the evolution of fluctuations in the density of matter, slowing
down the gravitational collapse of material (into, for example, clusters
of galaxies) in recent times. Additional fluctuations in the temperature
of CMB photons are induced as they pass through large-scale structures
and these fluctuations are necessarily correlated with the distribution
of relatively nearby matter. Here we report the detection of
correlations between recent CMB data and two probes of large-scale
structure: the X-ray background and the distribution of radio galaxies.
These correlations are consistent with those predicted by dark energy,
indicating that we are seeing the imprint of dark energy on the growth
of structure in the Universe.},

such as the van Dam, Veltman, and Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity and the

progress of the last decade is reviewed, including the dissolution of
the vDVZ discontinuity via the Vainshtein screening mechanism, the
existence of a consistent effective field theory with a stable hierarchy
between the graviton mass and the cutoff, and the existence of
particular interactions which raise the maximal effective field theory
cutoff and remove the ghosts. In addition, some peculiarities of massive
gravitons on curved space, novel theories in three dimensions, and
examples of the emergence of a massive graviton from extra dimensions

may be viewed as a suitable limit of bimetric gravity. The limiting
procedure is more delicate than currently appreciated. Specifically,
this limiting procedure should not unnecessarily constrain the
background metric, which must be externally specified by the theory of
massive gravity itself. The fact that in bimetric theories one always
has two sets of metric equations of motion continues to have an effect
even in the massive gravity limit, leading to additional constraints
besides the one set of equations of motion naively expected. Thus, since
solutions of bimetric gravity in the limit of vanishing kinetic term are
also solutions of massive gravity, but the contrary statement is not
necessarily true, there is no complete continuity in the parameter space
of the theory. In particular, we study the massive cosmological
solutions which are continuous in the parameter space, showing that many
interesting cosmologies belong to this class.},

gravity when approaching the source. In the second part of the paper, we
explore new exact vacuum solutions, that asymptote to de Sitter or anti
de Sitter space depending on the choice of parameters. The curvature of
the space is proportional to the mass of the graviton, thus providing a
cosmological background which may explain the present-day acceleration
in terms of the graviton mass. Moreover, by expressing the potential for

the same constraint that removes the Boulware-Deser ghost in this theory
also prohibits the existence of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological
solutions. Nevertheless, within domains of the size of inverse graviton
mass we find approximately homogeneous and isotropic solutions that can
well describe the past and present of the Universe. At energy densities
above a certain crossover value, these solutions approximate the
standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker evolution with great accuracy. As
the Universe evolves and density drops below the crossover value the
inhomogeneities become more and more pronounced. In the low-density
regime each domain of the size of the inverse graviton mass has
essentially non-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker. cosmology. This scenario
imposes an upper bound on the graviton mass, which we roughly estimate
to be an order of magnitude below the present-day value of the Hubble
parameter. The bound becomes especially restrictive if one utilizes an
exact self-accelerated solution that this theory offers. Although the
above are robust predictions of massive gravity with an explicit mass
term, we point out that if the mass parameter emerges from some
additional scalar field condensation, the constraint no longer forbids
the homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies. In the latter case, there
will exist an extra light scalar field at cosmological scales, which is
screened by the Vainshtein mechanism at shorter distances.},

analyze the nonlinear massive gravity proposed by de Rham, Gabadadze,

dynamical and the fixed reference metric. We show that this is not
compatible with the standard description of cosmological sources in
terms of effective perfect fluids, and the predictions of the theory
become sensitive either to the detailed field-theoretical modelling of
the matter content or to the presence of additional dark degrees of
freedom. This is a serious practical complication. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that viable cosmological background evolution with a perfect
fluid appears to require the presence of fields with highly contrived
properties. This could be improved if the equivalence principle is
broken by coupling only some of the fields to the composite metric, but
viable self-accelerating solutions due only to the massive graviton are

massive graviton cold dark matter scenario (MGCDM) in which gravitons
are geometrically treated as massive particles. In this modified gravity
theory, the main effect of the gravitons is to alter the density
evolution of the cold dark matter component in such a way that the
Universe evolves to an accelerating expanding regime, as presently
observed. Tight constraints on the main cosmological parameters of the
MGCDM model are derived by performing a joint likelihood analysis
involving the recent supernovae type Ia data, the cosmic microwave
background shift parameter, and the baryonic acoustic oscillations as
traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey red luminous galaxies. The linear
evolution of small density fluctuations is also analyzed in detail. It
is found that the growth factor of the MGCDM model is slightly different
({\tilde}1-4\%) from the one provided by the conventional flat
{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. The growth rate of clustering predicted by MGCDM
and {$\Lambda$}CDM models are confronted to the observations and the
corresponding best fit values of the growth index ({$\gamma$}) are also
determined. By using the expectations of realistic future x-ray and
Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster surveys we derive the dark matter halo mass
function and the corresponding redshift distribution of cluster-size
halos for the MGCDM model. Finally, we also show that the Hubble flow
differences between the MGCDM and the {$\Lambda$}CDM models provide a halo
redshift distribution departing significantly from the those predicted
by other dark energy models. These results suggest that the MGCDM model
can observationally be distinguished from {$\Lambda$}CDM and also from a
large number of dark energy models recently proposed in the literature.},

gravity is governed by a f(R) theory, a number of issues should be
reexamined in this framework, including the violation of causality
problem on nonlocal scale. We examine the question as to whether the
f(R) gravity theories permit space-times in which the causality is
violated. We show that the field equations of these f(R) gravity
theories do not exclude solutions with breakdown of causality for a
physically well-motivated perfect-fluid matter content. We demonstrate
that every perfect-fluid G{\"o}del-type solution of a generic f(R)
gravity satisfying the condition df/dR$\gt$0 is necessarily isometric to
the G{\"o}del geometry, and therefore presents violation of causality.
This result extends a theorem on G{\"o}del-type models, which has been
established in the context of general relativity. We also derive an
expression for the critical radius r$_{c}$ (beyond which the
causality is violated) for an arbitrary f(R) theory, making apparent
that the violation of causality depends on both the f(R) gravity theory
and the matter content. As an illustration, we concretely take a recent
f(R) gravity theory that is free from singularities of the Ricci scalar

explored, by considering an explicit nonminimal coupling between an
arbitrary function of the scalar curvature, R, and the Lagrangian
density of matter. It is the effective stress-energy tensor containing
the coupling between matter and the higher order curvature derivatives
that is responsible for the null energy condition violation, and
consequently for supporting the respective wormhole geometries. The
general restrictions imposed by the null energy condition violation are
presented in the presence of a nonminimal R-matter coupling.
Furthermore, obtaining exact solutions to the gravitational field
equations is extremely difficult due to the nonlinearity of the
equations, although the problem is mathematically well defined. Thus, we
outline several approaches for finding wormhole solutions, and deduce an
exact solution by considering a linear R nonmiminal curvature-matter
coupling and by considering an explicit monotonically decreasing
function for the energy density. Although it is difficult to find exact
solutions of matter threading the wormhole satisfying the energy
conditions at the throat, an exact solution is found where the
nonminimal coupling does indeed minimize the violation of the null
energy condition of normal matter at the throat.},

the transformations: {$\rho$} {\rarr} {$\rho$}$_{m}$ + {$\rho$}$_{E}$

  abstract      = {One of the most compelling tasks of modern cosmology is to constrain the
expansion history of the Universe, since this measurement can give
insights on the nature of dark energy and help to estimate cosmological
parameters. In this letter are presented two new measurements of the
Hubble parameter H(z) obtained with the cosmic chronometer method up to
z {\tilde} 2. Taking advantage of near-infrared spectroscopy of the few
very massive and passive galaxies observed at z $\gt$ 1.4 available in
literature, the differential evolution of this population is estimated
and calibrated with different stellar population synthesis models to
constrain H(z), including in the final error budget all possible sources
of systematic uncertainties (star formation history, stellar
metallicity, model dependences). This analysis is able to extend
significantly the redshift range coverage with respect to present-day
constraints, crossing for the first time the limit at z {\tilde} 1.75.
The new H(z) data are used to estimate the gain in accuracy on
cosmological parameters with respect to previous measurements in two
cosmological models, finding a small but detectable improvement
({\tilde}5 per cent) in particular on {$\Omega$}$_{M}$ and
w$_{0}$. Finally, a simulation of a Euclid-like survey has been
performed to forecast the expected improvement with future data. The
provided constraints have been obtained just with the cosmic
chronometers approach, without any additional data, and the results show
the high potentiality of this method to constrain the expansion history
of the Universe at these redshifts.},

the cosmic speedup of the Universe as a geometric effect. Background
evolution of the selfaccelerated solution is identical to that of
ordinary de Sitter space. I show that linear perturbations on this

a scalar, which are free of ghosts and tachyons for certain choices of
boundary conditions. The obtained linearized expressions suggest that
nonlinear interactions should, for certain boundary conditions, be
strongly coupled, although this issue is not studied here. The full
nonlinear Hamiltonian of the theory is shown to be positive for the
selfaccelerated solution, while in general, it reduces to surface terms

invariant under the finite dimensional conformal group, SO( {$\Delta$}, 2),
which guarantees the crossing symmetry and consistent factorization of
tree amplitudes. The spectrum of the level-two states is exhibited
explicitly as {$\Delta$} varies from 2 to 1 in order to illustrate the
manner in which the graviton (the lowest-mass spin-2 state) acquires a
mass. The scalar ghost generically associated with massive gravity
cancels with the ``dilaton'' precisely at {$\Delta$} = 1.},

  eprint        = {0708.3184},
  abstract      = {Just like the vector bosons in Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories,
gravitons can attain mass by spontaneous local symmetry breaking. The
question is whether this can happen in a Lorentz-invariant way. We
consider the use of four scalar fields that break coordinate
reparametrization invariance, by playing the role of preferred flat
coordinates x, y, z, and t. In the unbroken representation, the theory
has a (negative) cosmological constant, which is tuned to zero by the
scalars in the broken phase. Massive spin 2 bosons and a single massive
scalar survive. The theory is not renormalizable, so at best it can be
viewed as an effective field theory for massive spin 2 particles. One
may think of applications in cosmology, but a more tantalizing idea is
to apply it to string theory approaches to QCD: if the gluon sector is
to be described by a compactified 26 or 10 dimensional bosonic string
theory, then the ideas considered here could be used to describe the
mechanism that removes a massless or tachyonic scalar and provides mass
to the spin 2 glueball states. The delicate problem of removing
indefinite metric and/or negative energy states is addressed. The scalar
particle has negative metric, so that unitarity demands that only states
with an even number of them are allowed. Various ways are considered to
adapt the matter section of the theory such that matter only couples to
positive metric states, and we succeed in suppressing the main
contributions to unitarity-violating amplitudes, but the exact
restoration of unitarity in the spinless sector will continue to be a
delicate issue in theories of this sort.},

spontaneously broken by scalars, where the gravitational Higgs mechanism
results in massive gravity in Minkowski space with no nonunitary
propagating modes. This is achieved by including higher derivative terms
in the scalar sector. Decoupling the nonunitary mode (trace of the
graviton) then requires tuning a single parameter, namely, the
cosmological constant. We also discuss a setup where only spatial

Minkowski space with only transverse modes propagating, so the mode

weak field limit reduce to Yukawian potentials. We then apply our

exponential disk and compare it with the Newtonian case studied by
Freeman in 1970. As an application of the mathematical tool developed
here, we show that in any theory of gravity with a massive graviton
(this means a gravitational potential of the Yukawa type), a strong
limit can be imposed on the mass (m $_{g}$) of this particle. For
example, in order to obtain a galactic disk with a scale length of
b{\tilde} 10 kpc, we should have a massive graviton of m $_{g}$

those inferred from solar system observations.},

  abstract      = {Since the Newtonian gravitation is largely used to model with success
the structures of the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of
galaxies, for example, a way to probe and constrain alternative
theories, in the weak field limit, is to apply them to model the
structures of the universe. We then modified the well known Gadget-2
code to probe alternative theories of gravitation through galactic
dynamics. In particular, we modified the Gadget-2 code to probe
alternatives theories whose weak field limits have a Yukawa-like
gravitational potential. As a first application of this modified
Gadget-2 code we simulate the evolution of elliptical galaxies. These
simulations show that galactic dynamics can be used to constrain the
parameters associated with alternative theories of gravitation.},

  abstract      = {The {\ldquo}auxiliary extra-dimension{\rdquo} model was proposed in order
to provide a geometrical interpretation to modifications of general
relativity, in particular to non-linear massive gravity. In this
context, the theory was shown to be ghost free to third order in
perturbations, in the decoupling limit. In this work, we exactly solve
the equation of motion in the extra dimension, to obtain a purely
4-dimensional theory. Using this solution, it is shown that the ghost
appears at the fourth order and beyond. We explore potential
modifications to address the ghost issue and find that their consistent
implementation requires going beyond the present framework.},

  abstract  = {If gravitation is propagated by a massive field, then the velocity of
gravitational waves (gravitons) will depend upon their frequency as
(v$_{g}$/c)$^{2}$=1-(c/f{$\lambda$}$_{g}$)$^{2}$,
and the effective Newtonian potential will have a Yukawa form
\~{}r$^{-1}$exp(-r/{$\lambda$}$_{g}$), where
{$\lambda$}$_{g}$=h/m$_{g}$c is the graviton Compton
wavelength. In the case of inspiralling compact binaries, gravitational
waves emitted at low frequency early in the inspiral will travel
slightly slower than those emitted at high frequency later, resulting in
an offset in the relative arrival times at a detector. This modifies the
phase evolution of the observed inspiral gravitational waveform, similar
to that caused by post-Newtonian corrections to quadrupole phasing.
Matched filtering of the waveforms could bound such frequency-dependent
variations in propagation speed, and thereby bound the graviton mass.
The bound depends on the mass of the source and on noise characteristics
of the detector, but is independent of the distance to the source,
except for weak cosmological redshift effects. For observations of
stellar-mass compact inspiral using ground-based interferometers of the
LIGO-VIRGO type, the bound on {$\lambda$}$_{g}$ could be of the order
of 6{\times}10$^{12}$ km, about double that from solar-system tests
of Yukawa modifications of Newtonian gravity. For observations of
massive black hole binary inspiral at cosmological distances using the
proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the bound could be
as large as 6{\times}10$^{16}$ km. This is three orders of
magnitude weaker than model-dependent bounds from galactic cluster
dynamics.},

examine the basic properties of these gravitational degrees of freedom,
particularly setting an upper bound on their mass. It is timely to
review what the mass of these gravitational degrees of freedom means
from the theoretical point of view, particularly taking into account the
recent developments in constructing consistent massive gravity theories.
Apart from the GW150914 mass bound, a few other observational bounds
have been established from the effects of the Yukawa potential, modified
dispersion relation, and fifth force that are all induced when the
fundamental gravitational degrees of freedom are massive. These
different mass bounds are reviewed, how they stand in the wake of recent
theoretical developments and how they compare to the bound from GW150914

  abstract      = {We study a contracting universe composed of cold dark matter and radiation, and with a positive cosmological constant. As is well known from standard cosmological perturbation theory, under the assumption of initial quantum vacuum fluctuations the Fourier modes of the comoving curvature perturbation that exit the (sound) Hubble radius in such a contracting universe at a time of matter-domination will be nearly scale-invariant. Furthermore, the modes that exit the (sound) Hubble radius when the effective equation of state is slightly negative due to the cosmological constant will have a slight red tilt, in agreement with observations. We assume that loop quantum cosmology captures the correct high-curvature dynamics of the space-time, and this ensures that the big-bang singularity is resolved and is replaced by a bounce. We calculate the evolution of the perturbations through the bounce and find that they remain nearly scale-invariant. We also show that the amplitude of the scalar perturbations in this cosmology depends on a combination of the sound speed of cold dark matter, the Hubble rate in the contracting branch at the time of equality of the energy densities of cold dark matter and radiation, and the curvature scale that the loop quantum cosmology bounce occurs at. Importantly, as this scenario predicts a positive running of the scalar index, observations can potentially differentiate between it and inflationary models. Finally, for a small sound speed of cold dark matter, this scenario predicts a small tensor-to-scalar ratio.},

This is achieved through an expansion of the full functional Wheeler-DeWitt equation with respect to powers of the gravitational constant. The correction terms fall into two classes: One describes the breakdown of the classical background picture while the other corresponds to quantum gravitational corrections for the matter fields themselves. The latter are independent of the factor ordering which is chosen for the gravitational kinetic term. If the total state evolves adiabatically, the only correction term that survives contains the square of the matter Hamiltonian. In the general case there are also smaller terms which describe a gravitationally induced violation of unitarity. The corrections are numerically extremely tiny except near the big bang and the final stages of a black hole. They are also of principle significance for quantum field theories near the Planck scale.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the origin of the quasiclassical realm from the no-boundary proposal for the Universe{\rsquo}s quantum state in a class of minisuperspace models. The models assume homogeneous, isotropic, closed spacetime geometries, a single scalar field moving in a quadratic potential, and a fundamental cosmological constant. The allowed classical histories and their probabilities are calculated to leading semiclassical order. For the most realistic range of parameters analyzed, we find that a minimum amount of scalar field is required, if there is any at all, in order for the Universe to behave classically at late times. If the classical late time histories are extended back, they may be singular or bounce at a finite radius. The ensemble of classical histories is time symmetric although individual histories are generally not. The no-boundary proposal selects inflationary histories, but the measure on the classical solutions it provides is heavily biased towards small amounts of inflation. However, the probability for a large number of e-foldings is enhanced by the volume factor needed to obtain the probability for what we observe in our past light cone, given our present age. Our results emphasize that it is the quantum state of the Universe that determines whether or not it exhibits a quasiclassical realm and what histories are possible or probable within that realm.},

  abstract  = {We study cosmological perturbations in the framework of loop quantum cosmology, using a hybrid quantization approach and Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. The formulation in terms of these gauge invariants allows one to clarify the independence of the results on choices of gauge and facilitates the comparison with other approaches proposed to deal with cosmological perturbations in the context of loop quantum theory. A kind of Born-Oppenheimer ansatz is employed to extract the dynamics of the inhomogeneous perturbations, separating them from the degrees of freedom of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry. With this ansatz, we derive an approximate Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the cosmological perturbations and study its range of validity. We also prove that, with an alternate factor ordering, the dynamics deduced for the perturbations is similar to the one found in the so-called dressed metric approach, apart from a possible scaling of the matter field in order to preserve its unitary evolution in the regime of quantum field theory in a curved background and some quantization prescription issues. Finally, we obtain the effective equations that are naturally associated with the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables, both with and without introducing the Born-Oppenheimer ansatz, and with the different factor orderings that we have studied.},

The homogeneous setting consists of a massive scalar field propagating in a closed, homogeneous scenario. We provide a complete quantum description of the system employing loop quantization techniques. After introducing small inhomogeneities as scalar perturbations, we identify the true physical degrees of freedom by means of a partial gauge fixing, removing all the local degrees of freedom except the matter perturbations. We finally combine a Fock description for the inhomogeneities with the polymeric quantization of the homogeneous background, providing the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of the composed system. Its solutions are then completely characterized, owing to the suitable choice of quantum constraint, and the physical Hilbert space is constructed. Finally, we consider the analog description for an alternate gauge and, moreover, in terms of gauge-invariant quantities. In the deparametrized model, all these descriptions are unitarily equivalent at the quantum level.},

  year          = {2018},
  abstract      = {Since inflationary perturbations must generically couple to all degrees of freedom present in the early Universe, it is more realistic to view these fluctuations as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. Then, on very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad equation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system, as well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations constrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the interaction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes by the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths. Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the power spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the environment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but deteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not only of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical observations.},

DES DR1 is based on optical/near-infrared imaging from 345 distinct nights (August 2013 to February 2016) by the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4-m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. We release data from the DES wide-area survey covering ~5,000 sq. deg. of the southern Galactic cap in five broad photometric bands, grizY. DES DR1 has a median delivered point-spread function of g = 1.12, r = 0.96, i = 0.88, z = 0.84, and Y = 0.90 arcsec FWHM, a photometric precision of < 1% in all bands, and an astrometric precision of 151 mas. The median coadded catalog depth for a 1.95" diameter aperture at S/N = 10 is g = 24.33, r = 24.08, i = 23.44, z = 22.69, and Y = 21.44 mag. DES DR1 includes nearly 400M distinct astronomical objects detected in ~10,000 coadd tiles of size 0.534 sq. deg. produced from ~39,000 individual exposures. Benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain ~310M and ~ 80M objects, respectively, following a basic object quality selection. These data are accessible through a range of interfaces, including query web clients, image cutout servers, jupyter notebooks, and an interactive coadd image visualization tool. DES DR1 constitutes the largest photometric data set to date at the achieved depth and photometric precision.},

  abstract      = {Models for the latest stages of the cosmological evolution rely on a
less solid theoretical and observational ground than the description of
earlier stages like BBN and recombination. As suggested in a previous
work by Vonlanthen et al., it is possible to tweak the analysis of CMB
data in such way to avoid making assumptions on the late evolution, and
obtain robust constraints on ''early cosmology parameters''. We extend
this method in order to marginalise the results over CMB lensing
contamination, and present updated results based on recent CMB data. Our
constraints on the minimal early cosmology model are weaker than in a
standard {$\Lambda$}CDM analysis, but do not conflict with this model.
Besides, we obtain conservative bounds on the effective neutrino number
and neutrino mass, showing no hints for extra relativistic degrees of
freedom, and proving in a robust way that neutrinos experienced their
non-relativistic transition after the time of photon decoupling. This
analysis is also an occasion to describe the main features of the new
parameter inference code MONTE PYTHON, that we release together with
this paper. MONTE PYTHON is a user-friendly alternative to other public
codes like COSMOMC, interfaced with the Boltzmann code CLASS.},

  abstract = {Bayesian model selection is a tool for deciding whether the introduction of a new parameter is warranted by the data. I argue that the usual sampling statistic significance tests for a null hypothesis can be misleading, since they do not take into account the information gained through the data, when updating the prior distribution to the posterior. In contrast, Bayesian model selection offers a quantitative implementation of Occam's razor.  I introduce the Savage-Dickey density ratio, a computationally quick method to determine the Bayes factor of two nested models and hence perform model selection. As an illustration, I consider three key parameters for our understanding of the cosmological concordance model. By using Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-year data complemented by other cosmological measurements, I show that a non-scale-invariant spectral index of perturbations is favoured for any sensible choice of prior. It is also found that a flat universe is favoured with odds of 29:1 over non-flat models, and that there is strong evidence against a cold dark matter isocurvature component to the initial conditions which is totally (anti)correlated with the adiabatic mode (odds of about 2000:1), but that this is strongly dependent on the prior adopted.  These results are contrasted with the analysis of WMAP 1-year data, which were not informative enough to allow a conclusion as to the status of the spectral index. In a companion paper, a new technique to forecast the Bayes factor of a future observation is presented.},

  abstract      = {Among the various possibilities to probe the theory behind the recent         accelerated expansion of the universe, the energy conditions         (ECs) are of particular interest, since it is possible to         confront and constrain different theories of gravity with         observational data. In this context, we use the ECs to probe any         alternative theory of gravity whose extra term acts as a         cosmological constant. For this purpose, we apply a model-         independent approach to reconstruct the recent expansion of the         universe. Using Type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillations         and cosmic-chronometer data, we perform a Markov Chain Monte         Carlo analysis to put constraints on the effective cosmological         constant {\ensuremath{\Omega}}\^0\_eff. In addition, we find out         that about 30\% of the posterior distribution is incompatible         with a cosmological constant, showing that this method can         potentially rule it out as a mechanism for the accelerated         expansion. We also study the consequence of these constraints         for two particular formulations of the massive gravity in a         scenario where both theories mimic General Relativity with a         cosmological constant. Using the {\ensuremath{\Omega}}\^0\_eff         observational bounds along with the upper bounds on the graviton         mass we obtain constraints on the parameter spaces of both         theories. \textbackslash\textbackslash},

Establish their features in order to         discriminate and even rule out part of these models using         observational data is a fundamental issue of cosmology. In the         present work we consider a class of extended theories of gravity         (ETG) that are minimally coupled to the ordinary matter fields.         In this context, and assuming a homogeneous and isotropic         spacetime, we derive the energy conditions for this ETG class.         We then put constraints on these conditions using a model-         independent approach to reconstruct the deceleration function         along with the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) supernova         sample, 11 baryon acoustic oscillation and 22 cosmic-chronometer         measurements. We also consider an additional condition imposing         the strong energy condition only on the ordinary matter. This is         to guarantee the presence of only attractive matter in the         energy-momentum tensor, at least in the redshift range of the         observations, i.e., the recent accelerated expansion of the         Universe is due solely to the modifications in the gravity         theory. The main result of this work is a general reconstruction         of the energy conditions valid for every considered ETG.         \textbackslash\textbackslash},

The standard power-law spectrum is subject to long-         wavelength modifications described by some new parameters,         resulting in corrections to the anisotropies in the cosmic         microwave background. The new parameters are fitted to different         datasets: Planck 2015 data for temperature and for both         temperature and polarization, the low-redshift determination of         H$_{0}$, and distances derived from baryonic acoustic         oscillations. We discuss the statistical significance of the         modified spectra, from both frequentist and Bayesian         perspectives. Our analysis suggests motivations for considering         models that break scalar-tensor consistency, or models with         negligible power in the far super-Hubble limit. We present what         appears to be substantial evidence, according to the Jeffreys'         scale, for a new length scale around 2200 Mpc         (k$^{-1}${\ensuremath{\sim}}350 Mpc ) above which the primordial         (scalar) power spectrum is sharply reduced by about 20\%.},

We show that time parameters         fall into two distinct classes, that are such that the time         development of the wave function either always leads to the         appearance of a singularity (fast-gauge time) or that always         prevents it from occurring (slow-gauge time). Furthermore, we         find that, in the latter case, there exists an asymptotic         regime, independent of the clock choice. This may point to a         possible solution of the clock issue in quantum cosmology if         there exists a suitable class of clocks all yielding identical         relevant physical consequences.},

  abstract      = {Non-linear evolution causes the galaxy power spectrum to become broadly         correlated over different wavenumbers. It is shown that pre-         whitening the power spectrum - transforming the power spectrum         in such a way that the noise covariance becomes proportional to         the unit matrix - greatly narrows the covariance of power. The         eigenfunctions of the covariance of the pre-whitened non-linear         power spectrum provide a set of almost uncorrelated non-linear         modes somewhat analogous to the Fourier modes of the power         spectrum itself in the linear, Gaussian regime. These almost         uncorrelated modes make it possible to construct a near-minimum         variance estimator and Fisher matrix of the pre-whitened non-         linear power spectrum analogous to the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock         (FKP) estimator of the linear power spectrum. The paper         concludes with summary recipes, in gourmet, fine and fastfood         versions, of how to measure the pre-whitened non-linear power         spectrum from a galaxy survey in the FKP approximation.

It is based on the local use of radial basis functions and represents a further improvement of the well known Shepard's method. Although the latter is simple and well suited for multivariate interpolation, it does not share the good reproduction quality of other methods widely used for bivariate interpolation. On the other hand, radial basis functions, which have proven to be highly useful for multivariate scattered data interpolation, have a severe drawback. They are unable to interpolate large sets in an efficient and numerically stable way and maintain a good level of reproduction quality at the same time. Both problems have been circumvented using radial basis functions to evaluate the nodal function of the modified Shepard's method. This approach exploits the flexibility of the method and improves its reproduction quality. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and numerical results confirm its efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Angular statistics of cosmological observables are hard to compute. The         main difficulty is due to the presence of highly-oscillatory         Bessel functions which need to be integrated over. In this         paper, we provide a simple and fast method to compute the         angular power spectrum and bispectrum of any observable. The         method is based on using an FFTlog algorithm to decompose the         momentum-space statistics onto a basis of power-law functions.         For each power law, the integrals over Bessel functions have a         simple analytical solution. This allows us to efficiently         evaluate these integrals, independently of the value of the         multipole l. In particular, this method significantly speeds up         the evaluation of the angular bispectrum compared to existing         methods. To illustrate our algorithm, we compute the galaxy,         lensing and CMB temperature angular power spectrum and         bispectrum. \textbackslash\textbackslash},

The         latter encompasses all canonical transformations, whilst the         time and field redefinition is a distinct, noncanonical         transformation since the initial and destination systems use         different times. Actions related to each other via such         transformations yield identical equations of motion and preserve         the commutator structure. They further preserve the time         evolution of expectation values of quantum operators unless the         vacuum state also changes under the transformation. These         properties suggest that it is of interest to investigate vacuum         prescriptions that also remain unchanged under canonical         transformations. We find that initial conditions derived via         minimizing the vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian and         those obtained using the Danielsson vacuum prescription are not         invariant under these transformations, whereas those obtained by         minimizing the local energy density are invariant. We derive the         range of physically distinct initial conditions obtainable by         Hamiltonian diagonalization, and illustrate their effect on the         scalar primordial power spectrum and the cosmic microwave         background under the ``just enough inflation'' model. We also         generalize the analogy between the dynamics of a quantum scalar         field on a curved, time-dependent spacetime and the gauge-         invariant curvature perturbation. We argue that the invariance         of the vacuum prescription obtained by minimizing the         renormalized stress-energy tensor should make it the preferred         procedure for setting initial conditions for primordial         perturbations. All other procedures reviewed in this work yield         ambiguous initial conditions, which is problematic both in         theory and in practice.},

  abstract      = {This article investigates the predictions of an inflationary phase starting from a homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the Bianchi I type. After discussing the evolution of the background spacetime, focusing on the number of e-folds and the isotropization, we solve the perturbation equations and predict the power spectra of the curvature perturbations and gravity waves at the end of inflation. The main features of the early anisotropic phase is (1) a dependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes, (2) a coupling between curvature perturbations and gravity waves, and (3) the fact that the two gravity waves polarisations do not share the same spectrum on large scales. All these effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales where isotropy is recovered. They depend on a characteristic scale that can, but a priori must not, be tuned to some observable scale. To fix the initial conditions, we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in inflation but that takes into account the fact that the WKB regime is violated at early times when the shear dominates. We stress that there exist modes that do not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for which the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial conditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study paves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a primordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the importance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates that when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge toward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are less robust in the case of an inflationary era with a small number of e-folds.},

  abstract      = {We present the v1.0 release of CLMM, an open source Python library for the estimation of the weak lensing masses of clusters of galaxies. CLMM is designed as a standalone toolkit of building blocks to enable end-to-end analysis pipeline validation for upcoming cluster cosmology analyses such as the ones that will be performed by the LSST-DESC. Its purpose is to serve as a flexible, easy-to-install and easy-to-use interface for both weak lensing simulators and observers and can be applied to real and mock data to study the systematics affecting weak lensing mass reconstruction. At the core of CLMM are routines to model the weak lensing shear signal given the underlying mass distribution of galaxy clusters and a set of data operations to prepare the corresponding data vectors. The theoretical predictions rely on existing software, used as backends in the code, that have been thoroughly tested and cross-checked. Combined, theoretical predictions and data can be used to constrain the mass distribution of galaxy clusters as demonstrated in a suite of example Jupyter Notebooks shipped with the software and also available in the extensive online documentation.},

  abstract      = {The scientific impact of current and upcoming photometric galaxy surveys is contingent on our ability to obtain redshift estimates for large numbers of faint galaxies. In the absence of spectroscopically confirmed redshifts, broad-band photometric redshift point estimates (photo-$z$s) have been superseded by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs) that encapsulate their nontrivial uncertainties. Initial applications of photo-$z$ PDFs in weak gravitational lensing studies of cosmology have obtained the redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$ by employing computationally straightforward stacking methodologies that violate the laws of probability. In response, mathematically self-consistent models of varying complexity have been proposed in an effort to answer the question, "What is the right way to obtain the redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$ from a catalog of photo-$z$ PDFs?" This letter aims to motivate adoption of such principled methods by addressing the contrapositive of the more common presentation of such models, answering the question, "Under what conditions do traditional stacking methods successfully recover the true redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$?" By placing stacking in a rigorous mathematical environment, we identify two such conditions: those of perfectly informative data and perfectly informative prior information. Stacking has maintained its foothold in the astronomical community for so long because the conditions in question were only weakly violated in the past. These conditions, however, will be strongly violated by future galaxy surveys. We therefore conclude that stacking must be abandoned in favor of mathematically supported methods in order to advance observational cosmology.},

  abstract      = {We determine the mass scale of Planck galaxy clusters using gravitational lensing mass measurements from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We have compared the lensing masses to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) mass proxy for 21 clusters in common, employing a Bayesian analysis to simultaneously fit an idealized CLASH selection function and the distribution between the measured observables and true cluster mass. We used a tiered analysis strategy to explicitly demonstrate the importance of priors on weak lensing mass accuracy. In the case of an assumed constant bias, $b_{SZ}$, between true cluster mass, $M_{500}$, and the Planck mass proxy, $M_{PL}$, our analysis constrains $1- b_{SZ} = 0.73\pm 0.10$ when moderate priors on weak lensing accuracy are used, including a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation of 8% to account for possible bias in lensing mass estimations. Our analysis explicitly accounts for possible selection bias effects in this calibration sourced by the CLASH selection function. Our constraint on the cluster mass scale is consistent with recent results from the Weighing the Giants program and the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project. It is also consistent, at 1.34$\sigma$, with the value needed to reconcile the Planck SZ cluster counts with Planck's base $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper a modification of the standard algorithm for non-negativity-constrained linear least squares regression is proposed. The algorithm is specifically designed for use in multiway decomposition methods such as PARAFAC and N-mode principal component analysis. In those methods the typical situation is that there is a high ratio between the numbers of objects and variables in the regression problems solved. Furthermore, very similar regression problems are solved many times during the iterative procedures used. The algorithm proposed is based on the de facto standard algorithm NNLS by Lawson and Hanson, but modified to take advantage of the special characteristics of iterative algorithms involving repeated use of non-negativity constraints. The principle behind the NNLS algorithm is described in detail and a comparison is made between this standard algorithm and the new algorithm called FNNLS (fast NNLS). © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
